    # Overview

    Extractor API extracts clean text from articles, as well as details like title, author, images and more.

    “Clean” text refers to text without boilerplate - advertising copy, subscription solicitations (“Subscribe to our newsletter!”), comments in the comment section and so on. In other words, the article part of an article page.

    The API is specifically designed for long-form content, rather than short-form content like product descriptions, image captions, etc.

    ## API Key

    To authenticate the **Extractor** endpoint, simply include the `apikey` parameter in your request URL. For all **Job** endpoints, you will need to include the `Authorization` header followed by the `Bearer` keyword and your API key. The documentation includes examples for both forms of authentication.

    If you don’t have an API key, you can head over to the [Pricing](/extractor-api-pricing/) page to sign up for a Free Plan or start a 14-day trial for any of the paid plans. Afterwards you’ll be redirected to your [Dashboard](/extractor-api-dashboard/), which will display your API key.

    ## Rate Limits

    Depending on your plan, you’ll have a different [rate limit](/extractor-api-pricing/). If you go over your limit, you'll receive a **429 response code**.

    ## Base URL

    All API requests will need to include the following base URL. Also note that none of the endpoints here will need a forward slash at the end.

    `https://extractorapi.com/api/v1`

      description: Given a target URL, this endpoint returns extracted text and other useful data. Protocols ("http://" or "https://") for the `url` parameter are optional, as the API will automatically add "http://" if it doesn't detect one. Also note that sometimes (but not always), parameters within your target URL will give you issues, so it's best to remove them.

      summary: Create Job
      description: |
        Create a job and begin extracting text from the provided list of URLs. Jobs will persist on the server, meaning they don't block your workflow. You can periodically check the status of your job via the **Job Status** endpoint, or even head to your [Jobs page](/jobs/) to view the status of the job and download results in .json or .csv formats. **Note that you can add a maximum of 1,000 URLs to a job at a time - any more, and the list will be cut off at the thousandth URL**.
